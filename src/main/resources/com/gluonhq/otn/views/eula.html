        <p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">You and Oracle acknowledge that neither Oracle nor Apple has any obligation under this Agreement to furnish technical support or updates for the Program.</p>

        <p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">If a third party makes a claim against You that Your use of the Program as provided in this Agreement infringes its intellectual property rights, Oracle, at its sole cost and expense, will defend You against the claim and indemnify You from the damages, liabilities, costs and expenses awarded by the court to the third party claiming infringement or the settlement agreed to by Oracle, if You do the following:</p>
        <p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p>
        <ul id="l2">
            <li style="padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><p style="display: inline;">notify Oracle promptly in writing, not later than 30 days after You receive notice of the claim (or sooner if required by applicable law);</p></li>
            <li style="padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><p style="display: inline;">give Oracle sole control of the defense and any settlement negotiations; and</p></li>
            <li style="padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><p style="display: inline;">give Oracle the information, authority, and assistance it needs to defend against or settle the claim.</p></li></ul>
        <p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p>
        <p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">If Oracle believes or it is determined that the Program may have violated a third party's intellectual property rights, Oracle may choose to either modify the Program to be non-infringing (while substantially preserving its utility or functionality) or obtain a license to allow for continued use, or if these alternatives are not commercially reasonable, Oracle may end the license for, and require return of, the Program and refund any fees You may have paid for it. Oracle will not indemnify You if You alter the Program or use it outside the scope of use identified in the Program's user documentation or if You use a version of the Program which has been superseded, if the infringement claim could have been avoided by using an unaltered current version of the Program. Oracle will not indemnify You to the extent that an infringement claim is based upon any material not furnished by Oracle. Oracle will not indemnify You to the extent that an infringement claim is based upon the combination of the Program with any products or services not provided by Oracle. Oracle will not indemnify You for infringement caused by Your actions against any third party if the Program as delivered to You and used in accordance with the terms of this agreement would not otherwise infringe any third party intellectual property rights. You and Oracle acknowledge that Apple will not be responsible for the investigation, defense, settlement or discharge of any third party claim that the Program or Your possession and use thereof infringes that third party's intellectual property rights. This section provides Your exclusive remedy for any infringement claims or damages.</p>
        <p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p>

        <p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">You may terminate this Agreement by destroying all copies of the Program. Your right to use the Program shall end immediately if You fail to comply with any of the terms set forth in this Agreement, or as otherwise set forth in the "License" section above, in which case You shall destroy all copies of the Program. Except as expressly set forth in the Server Product Agreement, the terms and conditions governing the Server Product Agreement are not affected by the termination of Your right to use the Program under this Agreement. The provisions of this Agreement that by their nature continue shall survive any expiration or termination of this Agreement.</p>
        <p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p>

Les parties ont exigé que le present contrat et tous les documents connexes soient rediges en anglais.</p>
