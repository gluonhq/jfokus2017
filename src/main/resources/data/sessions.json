The queuing system, whether ActiveMQ, OpenMQ, or WebLogic JMS, provides many more features and settings than appear in the Java EE documentation. This session looks at some of the important extended features and configuration settings. What would you need to optimize if your messages are large or you need to minimize prefetching? What is the best way to implement time-delayed messages? The presentation also looks at dangerous bugs that can be introduced via simple misconfigurations with pooled beans. The JMS APIs are deceptively simple, but getting an implementation into production and tuned correctly can be a bit trickier.

A common error is code that works when run sequentially but that misbehaves when run in parallel. This is often caused by programmers who are stuck in a mode of imperative, left-to-right thinking. This leads to an iterative style in which data is mutated and where the next result depends on the result of the previous computation, creating barriers to parallel computation.

Over the years, developers have come to associate application containers with monolithic application servers, but these containers provide help that is taken for granted. OS containers may appear to obviate the need for application containers: immutable images are very easy to use, so the old-style containerless development strategies make more sense for patching an application or installing a new service and then creating a new image and redeploying. But this doesn't mean that they remove the need for application containers.

Then, based on the results of call C, call D or E and then return the results to the original caller. Calls to A, B, C, D, and E are all async calls, and none should take longer than 10 seconds. If they do, then return a timeout to the original caller.

The presentation showcases modern Android libraries for reactive programming, RESTful clients, and annotations and discusses how these libraries can be applied to back-end Java development.\n","location":"Hilton - Franciscan Room A","capacity":30,"startTime":1474313400,"endTime":1474320600,"track":"CLIENT","type":"HOL (Hands-on Lab) Session","experienceLevel":"Advanced","speakersUuid":{"type":"java.lang.String","items":["14574696366550015q1n"]}},{"uuid":"1462837349818001JXIz","title":"Everything as Code: A Polyglot Journey","summary":"As modern, agile developers, we love to master several different languages all at once to be 100 percent productive. We define our development environments with Gradle. We implement our software in Java, Kotlin, or another JVM-based language. We use Groovy or Scala to test our code at different layers. We construct the build pipelines for our software by using a Groovy DSL or JSON. We use YAML and Python to describe the infrastructure and the deployment for our applications. We document our architectures with AsciiDoc and JRuby. Welcome to Babel! Making the right choice in this multitude of available languages is not easy. This code-intense, polyglot session is an opinionated journey into the modern era of software industrialization.","location":"Hilton - Plaza Room A","capacity":274,"startTime":1474340400,"endTime":1474343100,"track":"EMERGING_LANGUAGES","type":"BOF (Birds-of-a-Feather) Session","experienceLevel":"Introductory","speakersUuid":{"type":"java.lang.String","items":["14574694406980025Pre"]}},{"uuid":"14628461035990018TjZ","title":"IoT Security: Cases and Methods","summary":"In developing for IoT, security is not often the highest priority: APIs exposed without care and devices deployed with default passwords become gateways to your network and your data.

This session explores the requirements for building mobile applications (for Android, iOS, and so on, using cross-device solutions such as Gluon Mobile) in relation to cloud connectivity, including persistence, cross-device synchronization, back-end cloud synchronization, and dealing with connectivity issues on platforms such as Oracle Cloud.","location":"Parc 55 - Cyril Magnin II/III","capacity":268,"startTime":1474495200,"endTime":1474498800,"track":"CLOUD_SERVER","type":"Conference Session","experienceLevel":"Intermediate","speakersUuid":{"type":"java.lang.String","items":["14574694578670015DUM"]}}]
