This repository contains the latest code developed by Gluon for the JavaOne 2016 client application. This code itself builds upon earlier conference implementations developed by Gluon, and makes use of Gluon Mobile for cross-platform iOS and Android support. The source code in this repository is not the code for the official JavaOne application developed by Oracle, rather this code was developed by Gluon as an alternate implementation. Functionality includes session summary, presenter list, as well as a number of other views related to venues, sponsors, and exhibitors. Some functionality no longer operates, as backend services that were present during JavaOne 2016 have now been disabled. Source code is released as a sample of a professional Gluon Mobile application and therefore makes use of best practices.
